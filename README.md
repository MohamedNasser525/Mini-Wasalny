  <h1>Mini-Wasalny</h1>



<h2>Project Overview:</h2>
This is a Windows desktop application developed using the Dijkstras Algorithm that incorporates data structures and object-oriented programming concepts to display the shortest path between two cities.

<h2>Standards:</h2>
<pre>
• Using C++ programming language
• Using concepts of data structured
• Using concepts of object-oriented programming
• Using Gui
</pre>

<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<pre>
• Find shortest path
• Using algorithms
• Using data structured
</pre>

<h2>Requirements/Task(s):</h2>
<pre>
Task 1: add graph-towns and distance between them
Task 2: update graph data
Task 3: display graph data
Task 4: find shortest path between two towns
Task 5: display towns names in the shortest bath
</pre>

<h2>The steps\plan of our project:</h2>
Call data from files and using operations like: update, delete, and modify then implement Dijkstra algorithm to find shortest path and finally implement graph using adjacency list

<h2>Summarize what we learned:</h2>
<pre>
1. Using algorithms
2. Using files
3. Using data structured programming in project
4. How to use oop with structured programming in a project
</pre>
